* In the PermutedSortingTime1.png, merge sort and heap sort are both graphed, you can just barely see them because
    of the scale of insertion sort and the similarity/speed of sorting time between heap sort and merge sort compared to insertion.

* You may need to close the graphs after they display for the code to continue execution. But you definitely need to for the next graph to display.

		(Takes a while to execute Insertion Sort...)

	Option 2:
		1. Open Linux Terminal
		2. ls -l to see where you currently are
		3. cd into folder "CS340_Project1-master" is located
